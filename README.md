# SpectoV

**What I changed:**  
Refactored the Spectov homepage with internal routing, a clearer component structure, and a visually refreshed, fully responsive UI (320pxâ€“1920px+). Enhanced navigation using scroll-to-top on mount, hash-based deep linking, and improved state management. Added an auto-scrolling testimonials carousel, Tilt.js-powered interactive feature cards, and controlled forms for engagement.

**Why I changed it:**  
These updates were made to improve usability, maintainability, and visual appeal. Enhanced routing and state management create smoother navigation, while new interactive and responsive elements better engage users across all devices.

**How it improves the original:**  
The homepage is now more intuitive and engaging, making key information easier to access. Accessibility improvements and clear navigation boost discoverability and conversion potential, while robust form handling aids lead generation. The structure also sets a strong foundation for SEO, analytics, and future growth.
